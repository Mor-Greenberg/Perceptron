Binary Classification with Perceptron and Improved Perceptron
This project demonstrates binary classification on a breast cancer dataset using the Perceptron algorithm. Two models are implemented: a standard Perceptron and an Improved Perceptron with early stopping and best-weight tracking. Performance is evaluated on a custom split of the dataset.
ðŸ§  Features
- Implements both classic and improved versions of the Perceptron algorithm
- Early stopping and tolerance in the improved version
- Accuracy evaluation and error reporting on train/test sets
- Custom dataset split (60% train, 20% validation, 20% test)
ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The dataset is loaded and split into train/validation/test sets.
2. Both models are trained on the training set.
3. Predictions are made, and accuracy and error are computed on both training and test sets.
4. The improved model stops early if error falls below a set threshold.

Made as part of a Machine Learning course in 2025.
